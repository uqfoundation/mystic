Attempt to solve equations with no solution, with a constrained search.

The equations are:
    (x-x1)^2 + (y-y1)^2 - r1^2 = 0
    (x-x2)^2 + (y-y2)^2 - r2^2 = 0
    (x-x3)^2 + (y-y3)^2 - r3^2 = 0

with the given points (x,y) and a radii (r):
    x1, y1, r1 = (0, 0, 0.88)
    x2, y2, r2 = (2, 0, 1)
    x3, y3, r3 = (0, 2, 0.75)
