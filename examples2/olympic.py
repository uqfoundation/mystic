  Olympic puzzle in Google CP Solver.

  Prolog benchmark problem
  '''
  Name   : olympic.pl
  Author : Neng-Fa
  Date   : 1993

  Purpose: solve a puzzle taken from Olympic Arithmetic Contest

  Given ten variables with the following configuration:

                 X7   X8   X9   X10

                    X4   X5   X6

                       X2   X3

                          X1

  We already know that X1 is equal to 3 and want to assign each variable
  with a different integer from {1,2,...,10} such that for any three
  variables
                        Xi   Xj

                           Xk
  the following constraint is satisfied:

                      |Xi-Xj| = Xk
