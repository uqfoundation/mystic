"""
calculate upper bound on mean value of 0th input

Test function is y = F(x), where:
  y0 = x0 + x1 * | x2 * x3**2 - (x4 / x1)**2 |**.5
  y1 = x0 - x1 * | x2 * x3**2 + (x4 / x1)**2 |**.5
  y2 = x0 - | x1 * x2 * x3 - x4 |

model = lambda x: F(x)[0]

Calculate upper bound on mean(x[0]), where:
  x in [(0,1), (1,10), (0,10), (0,10), (0,10)]
  wx in [(0,1), (1,1), (1,1), (1,1), (1,1)]
  npts = [2, 1, 1, 1, 1] (i.e. two Dirac masses on x[0], one elsewhere)
  sum(wx[i]_j) for j in [0,npts], for each i
  E|model(x)| = 11.0 +/- 1.0

Solves for two scenarios of x that produce upper bound on mean(x[0]),
given the bounds, normalization, and moment constraints.
