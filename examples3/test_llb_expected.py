'''
hyperparameter tuning for least lower bound of ExpectedValue on model

Test function is y = F(x), where:
  y0 = x0 + x1 * | x2 * x3**2 - (x4 / x1)**2 |**.5
  y1 = x0 - x1 * | x2 * x3**2 + (x4 / x1)**2 |**.5
  y2 = x0 - | x1 * x2 * x3 - x4 |

toy = lambda x: F(x)[0]
model = lambda x: toy(x + mu) + zmu
for hyperparameters z = [mu, zmu]

Calculate least lower bound on E|model(x)|, where:
  x in [(0,1), (1,10), (0,10), (0,10), (0,10)]
  wx in [(0,1), (1,1), (1,1), (1,1), (1,1)]
  npts = [2, 1, 1, 1, 1] (i.e. two Dirac masses on x[0], one elsewhere)
  sum(wx[i]_j) for j in [0,npts], for each i
  mean(x[0]) = 5e-1 +/- 1e-3
  var(x[0]) = 5e-3 +/- 1e-4
  z in [(-10,10), (-10,10)]

Solves for z that produces least lower bound on E|model(x|z)|,
given the bounds, normalization, and moment constraints.

Creates 'log' of inner optimizations, and 'result' for outer optimization.

Check results while running (using log reader):
  $ mystic_log_reader log.txt -n 0 -g -p '0:2,2:4,5,7,9,11'
  $ mystic_log_reader result.txt -g -p '0,1'
