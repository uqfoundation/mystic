calculate upper bound on expected value

Test function is y = F(x), where:
  F is defined in surrogate.py

model = F(x)

Calculate upper bound on E|model(x)|, where:
  x in [(20.0,150.0), (0.0,30.0), (2.1,2.8)]
  wx in [(0,1), (1,1), (1,1)]
  npts = [2, 1, 1] (i.e. two Dirac masses on x[0], one elsewhere)
  sum(wx[i]_j) for j in [0,npts], for each i
  E|model(x)| = 6.5 +/- 1.0

Solves for two scenarios of x that produce upper bound on E|model(x)|,
given the bounds, normalization, and moment constraints.
