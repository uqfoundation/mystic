    performs an optimization for each ``x`` to find an appropriate ``x'``.

    *ytol* is a single value, while *xtol* is a single value or an iterable.
    *cutoff* takes a float or a boolean, where ``cutoff=True`` will set the
    value of *cutoff* to the default. Typically, the value of *cutoff* is
    *ytol*, 0.0, or None. *hausdorff* can be False (e.g. ``norm = 1.0``),
    True (e.g. ``norm = spread(x)``), or a list of points of ``len(x)``.

    While *cutoff* and *ytol* are very tightly related, they play a distinct
    role; *ytol* is used to set the optimization termination for an acceptable
    ``|y - F(x')|``, while *cutoff* is applied post-optimization.

    If we are using the *hausdorff* norm, then *ytol* will set the optimization
    termination for an acceptable ``|y - F(x')| + |x - x'|/norm``, where the
