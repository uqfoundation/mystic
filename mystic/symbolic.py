def simplify(constraints, variables='x', target=None, **kwds):
    """simplify a system of symbolic constraints equations.

Returns a system of equations where a single variable has been isolated on
the left-hand side of each constraints equation, thus all constraints are
of the form "x_i = f(x)".

Inputs:
    constraints -- a string of symbolic constraints, with one constraint
        equation per line. Standard python syntax should be followed (with
        the math and numpy modules already imported).

    For example:
        >>> constraints = '''
        ...     x0 - x2 <= 2.
        ...     x2 = x3*2.'''
        >>> print simplify(constraints)

        ...     x0 - x1 - 1.0 = mean([x0,x1])
        ...     mean([x0,x1,x2]) >= x2'''
        >>> print simplify(constraints)
        x0 = 3.0*x1 + 2.0
        x0 >= -x1 + 2*x2

Additional Inputs:
    variables -- desired variable name. Default is 'x'. A list of variable
        name strings is also accepted for when desired variable names
        don't have the same base, and can include variables that are not
        found in the constraints equation string.
    target -- list providing the order for which the variables will be solved.
        If there are "N" constraint equations, the first "N" variables given
        will be selected as the dependent variables. By default, increasing
        order is used.

Further Inputs:
    locals -- a dictionary of additional variables used in the symbolic
        constraints equations, and their desired values.
    cycle -- boolean to cycle the order for which the variables are solved.
        If cycle is True, there should be more variety on the left-hand side
        of the simplified equations. By default, the variables do not cycle.

Inputs:
    conditions -- a constraint solver, or list of constraint solvers
    ctype -- a mystic.constraints type, or a list of mystic.constraints types
        of the same length as the given conditions

NOTES:
    This simple constraint generator doesn't check for conflicts in conditions,
    but simply applies conditions in the given order. This constraint generator
    assumes that a single variable has been isolated on the left-hand side
    of each constraints equation, thus all constraints are of the form
    "x_i = f(x)". This solver picks speed over robustness, and thus relies on
    the user to formulate the constraints so that they do not conflict.

    For example:
        >>> constraints = '''
        ...     x0 = cos(x1) + 2.
        ...     x1 = x2*2.'''
        >>> solv = generate_solvers(constraints)
        >>> constraint = generate_constraint(solv)
        >>> constraint([1.0, 0.0, 1.0])
        [1.5838531634528576, 2.0, 1.0]

    Standard python math conventions are used. For example, if an 'int'
    is used in a constraint equation, one or more variable may be evaluate
    to an 'int' -- this can affect solved values for the variables.

    For example:
        >>> constraints = '''
        ...     x2 = x0/2.
        ...     x0 >= 0.'''
